Study the growth of crypto-currency and predict its future
The aim of this report is to analyze and study various cryptocurrencies and predict their future
in the global market. The dataset consists of the top 10 cryptocurrency coins ranked by their
total market value capture worldwide. The data was obtained from the CoinGecko API
documentation and visualized using Microsoft Power BI.
The visualizations are designed to provide insights into the behavior of these coins on different
parameters, such as historical prices, market value capture, total volume, all-time high and
low prices, open and close prices per day, and more. Additionally, the analysis delves into the
reasons behind price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies and highlights the importance of
blockchain technology in improving data management across different industries.
